This is a simple implementation of the Perlin algorithm.

The idea behind procedural textures is to describe the picture with math
functions instead of describing every pixel individually.

Since the late 90s the rise of computational power and storage increase has led
to very much resource abuse. One of them is the huge waste of space for textures
used in CGI and video games. Let's face it: if you are looking for decent
quality texture, you will need really big files. That's why video games texture
have not improved that much over the last decade.
